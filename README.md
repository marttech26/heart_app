##Project Overview:
The project revolves around predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical and demographic factors. The dataset contains information such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and other clinical attributes. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals as either having or not having heart disease.
##Problem Statement:
The primary problem is to build a reliable predictive model to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart disease at an early stage. By analyzing patient data, the model should accurately classify individuals into two categories: those who have heart disease and those who do not. This will enable proactive interventions and personalized treatments, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.

##Main Objective:
To develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the presence or absence of heart disease based on patient attributes. This model should achieve high performance metrics, indicating its effectiveness in aiding clinical decision-making.

##Specific Objectives:
To Prepare Data and visualize

To Engineer Informative Features.

To Select and Train Models.

To Evaluate Model Performance.

To Deploy and Monitor Mode
